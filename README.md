A version of snake written using sdl2 and Haskell. Not meant to be groundbreakingly fantastic, just a little coding exercise for myself.

Game Settings such as frame rate, board size, number of apples, etc. are editible in the json file found in the res folder.

Game Controls are stored in settings as SDL Scancodes. Scancodes can be calculated by using the stupid executable.
